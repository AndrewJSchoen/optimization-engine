*** OpenGen ***

Code generation tool for OpEn

To use this Python package, run:

$ pip install opengen

You will then be able to use it in your project with

from opengen import *

In order to build the auto-generated code, you need the 
Rust compiler. This is still work in progress. Further
documentation will be provided soon.
