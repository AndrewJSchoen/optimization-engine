# `PANOC`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/korken89/panoc-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/korken89/panoc-rs)

> `panoc` is a library for solving nonlinear optimization problems, utilizing the [PANOC solver].
> The solver only needs the cost function and gradient to be available, and the recommended way
> to generate these functions are via [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) 

Active WIP.
