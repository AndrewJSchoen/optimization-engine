# OpEn Jupyter Notebook

Hmm.. that [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/) framework looks really cool, but I'm too lazy to spend 2 minutes (!) to [install](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation) it!

Is there a way to try it quickly?!

## TaDa...

You can now download this docker image using

```console
docker pull alphaville/open
```

and then run it with

```console
docker run -p 8888:8888 alphaville/open
```

## What it does

It start a Jupyter Notebook at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). 

The password is **open**.
